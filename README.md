# InvoiceApp üßæ

InvoiceApp is a Python-based application developed as the final paper project for a subject at the faculty. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing invoices, stores, inventory, and generating PDF invoices. The app is designed to streamline the process of creating and managing invoices for different stores.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Administrator**: The app includes an administrator role responsible for managing stores and overseeing the overall functionality of the system.
